# Form-Validation
This a web-based application that demonstrates client-side form validation using JavaScript. It includes fields for name, email, telephone number, and password. Each field is validated upon losing focus (on blur), and the form as a whole is validated before submission. This ensures that the input meets specified criteria before it is accepted.
